We look into the small mysteries most people overlook.\n\nLately, someone calling themselves the **Phinney Phantom** has been leaving strange clues in familiar places around Phinney Ridge. Each one leads to another location and puzzle, but our team stalled while following the trail. We need fresh eyes.\n\nThis morning, a new note appeared at the Phinney Center that matches the Phantom’s earlier work. It looks like an invitation.\n\n{{handwritten}}I need someone more clever,\nSomeone who won’t be vexed.\nFind and solve the first puzzle,\nI’ll show you where to go next.\n— PP\n{{/handwritten}}\n\nThis is your case now.
